# Caesar encryption with Python
including encryption and decryption and attack sections
## Encryption
In the first part, we make the key by shifting 3 letters.
## Decryption
In the second part, we reverse the key and encrypt the encrypted text with that key to get the original text.
## Attack to find the original text 
In the third part, due to the weakness of the algorithm and having only 26 keys, we try all 26 keys.
